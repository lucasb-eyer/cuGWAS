cuGWAS
======

High-performance GWAS implementation based on CUDA/cuBLAS. This is the code from my diploma (eq. masters) thesis. (Sorry AMD, no more time :-()

Since the paper is written now, I "only" need to extract the code from a bigger unreleased codebase and make it useable standalone. This may take a little time.
